    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 1: Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "* Import the data and investigate variables to check if they are imported correctly.\n",
    "* Perform missing value imputation for income values.\n",
    "* Clean the data, if necessary.\n",
    "* Create variables to populate the total number of children, age, and total spending.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 2: Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create box plots and histograms to understand the distributions and outliers.\n",
    "* Perform outlier treatment.\n",
    "* ~~Use ordinal encoding and one hot encoding according to different types of categorical variables.~~\n",
    "* Create a heatmap to showcase the correlation between different pairs of variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 3: Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Test the following hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Older people are not as tech-savvy and probably prefer shopping in-store.\n",
    "* Customers with kids probably have less time to visit a store and would prefer to shop online.\n",
    "* Other distribution channels may cannibalize sales at the store.\n",
    "* Does the US fare significantly better than the rest of the world in terms of total purchases?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stage 4: Data Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Use appropriate visualization to help analyze the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which products are performing the best, and which are performing the least in terms of revenue?\n",
    "* Is there any pattern between the age of customers and the last campaign acceptance rate?\n",
    "* Which Country has the greatest number of customers who accepted the last campaign?\n",
    "* Do you see any pattern in the no. of children at home and total spend?\n",
    "* Education background of the customers who complained in the last 2 years.\n"
